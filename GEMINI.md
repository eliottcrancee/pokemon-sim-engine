This project is a Pokemon battle simulator that allows users to pit different AI agents against each other in strategic battles. The simulator supports various AI strategies, including Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms, enabling users to evaluate and compare their performance in a controlled environment.

When coding, please use clean code principles to ensure readability and maintainability :
- The code should be really efficient using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Use meaningful variable and function names in English.
- Write modular code by breaking down complex functions into smaller, reusable components.
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes to explain their purpose and usage.
- Follow consistent coding convetions.
- Avoid deep nesting by using early returns and helper functions.
